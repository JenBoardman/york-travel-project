            <h2>WHY YORK?</h2>
            <h3>York, home of the shambles and medieval architecture.</h3>
            <p>
              York is one of England's finest and most beautiful historic
              cities. The Romans knew it as Eboracum. To the Saxons it was
              Eoforwick. The Vikings, who came as invaders but stayed on in
              settlements, called it Jorvik. York's more recent history has also
              characterised the city. There's the iconic York Minster and
              architecture from medieval times, its magnificent Georgian town
              houses and its Victorian railway station.As you explore York you
              will discover that every aspect of York's modern life is
              inextricably linked with its past. Within its ancient, encircling
              walls, York's medieval streets and buildings are beautifully
              preserved in the historic heart of the city. Shambles is a
              must-visit, as one of the most recognised historic streets in
              England, often referred to as the best-preserved medieval street
              in Europe.
